PyTorch implementation of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Game Model in crowdshipping.

Abstract: This study addresses a dynamic crowdshipping vehicle routing problem with stochastic capacity and available time of crowd-shippers. A combination approach of hierarchical reinforcement learning and game theory model that handles batch-matching, orders allocation, and route planning. The upper agent balances the opportunities and risks brought by delayed batch- matching. The Nash game model classify crowd-shipping vehicle to allocate appropriate orders. The lower agent takes care of routing. The proposed system secures outperform 10% improvement on average versus the benchmarking approach.

Keywords: Crowdshipping, Hierarchy Reinforcement Learning, Nash Game, Dual-Decoder Attention Model.
